# MITRE Frameworks - Threat Intelligence & Defense 

This repository explores MITREâ€™s cybersecurity frameworks, including **ATT&CKÂ®, CAR, Engage, and D3FEND**, through a guided learning path.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction to MITRE
**Overview of MITREâ€™s Role in Cybersecurity**  
- Nonprofit organization supporting U.S. government cyber defense.  
- Key contributions: ATT&CKÂ®, CAR, Engage, D3FEND.  
- Focus: Standardizing threat modeling, detection, and response.  

> *Goal*: Understand how MITRE frameworks map adversary behaviors and improve defenses.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 2: Basic Terminology
**Key MITRE Concepts**  
- **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures)**: How adversaries operate.  
- **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)**: Long-term attacker campaigns.  
- **Emulation Plans**: Simulating real-world attacks.  

*Exercise*: Match terms (e.g., "Lateral Movement") to their definitions.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 3: ATT&CKÂ® Framework
**Adversary Tactics & Techniques**  
- **Matrix Structure**: 14 Tactics (e.g., "Persistence," "Lateral Movement").  
- **Technique IDs**: e.g., `T1059` (Command-Line Interface).  
- **Use Cases**: Threat intelligence, detection engineering.  

*Exercise*: Find a technique used by APT29 in the [ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/).

---

## ðŸŽ¯  4: CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository)
**Detection Analytics**  
- **Analytics Library**: Open-source detection rules.  
- **Mapping to ATT&CK**: e.g., "CAR-2021-04-002" detects PowerShell abuse.  
- **Data Sources**: Logs, network traffic, process monitoring.  

*Exercise*: Write a Sigma rule for `T1059` (Command-Line Interface).

---

## ðŸŽ¯  5: MITRE Engage
**Adversary Engagement**  
- **Deception Strategies**: Honeypots, breadcrumbs.  
- **Operational Planning**: "Prepare, Act, Monitor" phases.  
- **Use Case**: Misleading attackers with fake data.  

*Exercise*: Design a honeypot scenario for credential theft.

---

## ðŸŽ¯  6: MITRE D3FEND
**Defensive Countermeasures**  
- **Defense Matrix**: Maps protections to ATT&CK techniques.  
- **Categories**: e.g., "Encrypt," "Segment," "Authenticate."  
- **Example**: D3-ACH mitigates `T1110` (Brute Force).  

*Exercise*: Propose defenses for `T1078` (Valid Accounts).

---

## ðŸŽ¯  7: ATT&CKÂ® Emulation Plans
**Simulating Real Attacks**  
- **APT Emulations**: e.g., FIN6, Lazarus Group.  
- **Red Team Guides**: Step-by-step attack simulations.  
- **Tools**: Caldera, Atomic Red Team.  

*Exercise*: Run an emulation for `Tactic TA0002` (Execution).

---

## ðŸŽ¯  8: ATT&CKÂ® & Threat Intelligence
**Operationalizing Intelligence**  
- **Mapping IOCs to ATT&CK**: e.g., malware â†’ `T1204` (User Execution).  
- **Threat Reports**: Analyzing groups like APT29.  
- **Automation**: STIX/TAXII feeds.  

*Exercise*: Map a threat report to ATT&CK techniques.

---

## ðŸŽ¯  9: Conclusion
**Key Takeaways**  
- **ATT&CK**: Universal adversary language.  
- **CAR/D3FEND**: Bridge detection and defense.  
- **Engage**: Active defense strategies.
